[#runtime_overview]
== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes runtime capabilities overview
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) enables security operators to manage runtime security for container workloads. RHACS can create baselines for container runtime process and network activity, and respond to specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) detected in running container images.

In this lab, we'll test out some of the runtime capabilities provided with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes. We'll use some of the out-of-the-box policies to detect and mitigate runtime threats, and see how alerts are created for this activity.

[#runtime_architecture]
== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes runtime monitoring architecture
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) uses an extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) probe to detect runtime activity in containers. eBPF allows sandboxed programs to run in a privileged context, such as the operating system kernel. This means that eBPF can provide observability into the kernel, in a secure and isolated way. You can read more about eBPF at ebpf.io[https://ebpf.io/].

ACS deploys an eBPF program to Kubernetes nodes during installation, providing observability into container process execution and network traffic flows at runtime. This means that we don't need agents running in containers, or make any changes to container workloads at all to support runtime monitoring and threat detection.

[#ebpf_development]
== eBPF Background
The development of eBPF can be attributed to Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson, who first published a paper on the subject in 1992. At the time, it was named the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution[BSD Packet Filter] due to its development on BSD. As the application became more widely adopted, it was renamed the Berkeley Packet Filter due to its development at the https://www.lbl.gov/[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory].

BPF has been around for many years without fame, although other applications have used it. For example, https://www.tcpdump.org/[tcpdump] is https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf[built on top of BPF], and the BPF program can be viewed using the -d flag.
```
sudo tcpdump -d "tcp dst port 22"
(000) ldh [12]
(001) jeq #0x86dd jt 2 jf 6
...
(014) ret #262144
(015) ret #0
```
It wasnâ€™t until Alexei Starovoitov altered BPF and created the https://lwn.net/Articles/599755/[extended BPF] to leverage advances in modern hardware.

Since the addition of eBPF to the Linux kernel in December 2014 (v3.18), there have been a few upgrades. eBPF can be used for non-networking purposes, such as for attaching eBPF programs to various tracepoints. Since kernel version 3.19, users can attach eBPF filters to sockets, and, since kernel version 4.1, to traffic control classifiers for the ingress and egress networking data path.

eBPF works by creating filters directly in the kernel, allowing observability into container process execution and network traffic flows.

[#ebpf_action]
== RHACS and eBPF in action

Let's try out some of the eBPF runtime monitoring provided with RHACS.

Access the RHACS interface and select `Policies`. Perform a Policy search for `netcat`.

image::runtime/172_runtime_policy.png[policy 1, 800]

Select the `Netcat Execution Detected` policy.

image::runtime/173_runtime_netcat.png[netcat 1, 800]

We can see some important information about this policy:

* This policy detects `netcat` execution in container workloads
* `netcat` execution may represent attackers trying to move laterally throughout the network
* This policy is currently enabled and set to 'Inform'. This means that it will create violations within RHACS that can be forwarded to configured SIEMs, but no action will be taken.
* This policy applies to the runtime lifecyle for a container workload, meaning that the eBPF sensor will be used to detect `netcat` execution inside container workloads.

Now that we know this policy is enabled and set to `Inform`, let's see it in action. 

Navigate to the OpenShift console and observe the workloads deployed to the `devops` namespace. You should see a single workload named `log4shell-app`.

image::runtime/174_log4shell_app.png[app 1, 800]

Open a terminal session into the currently running pod, and try connecting to the Kubernetes API.
```
nc kubernetes.default.svc 443 -v
```
You should see that the API is reachable from the pod using `netcat`.

image::runtime/175_app_nc.png[app 2, 800]

Navigate back to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes and select `Violations`. Filter by `Deployment: log4shell-app` and you will see that a violation has been created for `Netcat Execution Detected`.

image::runtime/176_nc_violations.png[app 3, 800]

If you select the vioation you'll be able to see more information about this event:

* The user who executed `netcat` within the container (in this case, the root user, UID 0)
* The path for the binary (`/usr/bin/nc`)
* The arguments (`kubernetes.default.svc 443 -v`)

image::runtime/177_nc_events.png[nc 1, 800]

We can also see information about the workload has been captured:

* The deployment name (`log4shell-app`)
* The namespace (`devops`)
* The cluster (`production`)
* Volumes
* Exposed ports

image::runtime/178_nc_deployments.png[nc 2, 800]

image::runtime/179_nc_ports.png[nc 3, 800]

Great! We can now detect suspicious process execution inside container workloads, create violations within RHACS, and forward these notifications to configured SIEMS for further analysis.

[#ebpf_enforcement]
== RHACS and runtime enforcement

In the example above we looked at creating violations and notifications about suspicious process activity. RHACS also allows us to take some initial actions to contain and eradicate threats, which have been detected through runtime activity monitoring.

Containment and eradication are important components of the incident response lifecycle. Containment usually involves stopping attackers moving laterally, and containing an attack. It might involve disconnecting systems from networks, quarantining infected systems, or blocking traffic. Eradication usually follows containment, and involves removing the attacker's presence from systems and networks.

Using the Kubernetes API we can create automated actions that support containment and eradication. We can use the Kubernetes API to recreate workloads on the platform, removing the attacker presence while at the same destroying any attacker-controlled processes. This doesn't negate further analysis and threat hunting, but it provides an important response mechanism that we can use to mitigate further attacker access. Let's take a look.

Navigate to the RHACS interface and select `Policies`. Perform a search for `netcat` and select the `Edit Policy` option on the right.

image::runtime/1711_nc_edit.png[nc 1, 800]

Navigate through to `Policy behavior` and update the policy:

* Update the `Response method` from `Inform` to `Inform and enforce`.
* Select the option to `Enforce on Runtime`

image::runtime/1712_nc_enforce.png[nc 2, 800]

Select `Next` to advance through the next screens until you reach `Review policy`. You should see on this screen that the `Response` is set to `Enforce`, and that `Enforcement` is set to `Runtime`.

image::runtime/1713_nc_save.png[nc 2, 800]

Select `Save`.

Navigate to the OpenShift console and open a new terminal session into the running pod for the `log4shell-app` workload.

image::runtime/1714_nc_terminal.png[nc 3, 800]

Try and connect to the Kubernetes API using `netcat`

```
nc kubernetes.default.svc 443 -v
```
This time you'll notice that the terminal session is lost. `netcat` execution has been detected by the ACS eBPF sensor, and the platform has flagged that this violates the `Netcat Execution Detected` policy. In response, the container workload has been recreated, immediately destroying any attacker-controlled processes.

image::runtime/1715_nc_enforced.png[nc 4, 800]

Navigate to `Violations` in the RHACS console and you'll be able to see a new violation has been created for `Netcat Execution Detected`. This time you'll see that the `Enforced` column has entries for the number of enforcement actions.

image::runtime/1716_nc_enforced_violations.png[nc 5, 800]

Select this violation and you will now see an `Enforcement` tab has been created. This shows that the pod has been destroyed and recreated twice, in response to `netcat` execution events.

image::runtime/1717_nc_enforced_tab.png[nc 6, 800]
