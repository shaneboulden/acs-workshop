= Compliance Operator and Compliance in ACS
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:profile: acs

The OpenShift Compliance Operator allows OpenShift Container Platform administrators to define the desired compliance state of a cluster and provides an overview of gaps and ways to remediate any non-compliant policy.

The OpenShift Compliance Operator assesses both Kubernetes API resources and OpenShift Container Platform resources, as well as the nodes running the cluster. The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies provided by the content.

[#compliance_operator]
== Integrating the OpenShift Compliance Operator with ACS 

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes supports OpenShift Container Platform configuration compliance standards through an integration with the OpenShift Container Platform Compliance Operator. 

The Compliance Operator has already been installed on OpenShift for you. You can verify this by looking at the pods runing in the `openshift-compliance` namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc get pod -n openshift-compliance
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc get pod -n openshift-compliance
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
compliance-operator-5989ff994b-mrhc9            1/1     Running   1          4m42s
ocp4-openshift-compliance-pp-6d7c7db4bd-2gnrf   1/1     Running   0          3m2s
rhcos4-openshift-compliance-pp-c7b548bd-k4sz2   1/1     Running   0          3m2s

[#compliance_operator_scan]
=== Running compliance scans

OpenShift uses a `ScanSettingBinding` to configure settings for the Compliance Operator. In this workshop the Compliance Operator has already been configured with a `ScanSettingBinding` object that uses the "Essential Eight" profiles.

* Check that a ScanSettingBinding object has been created that binds to the default ScanSetting object and scans the cluster using the `rhcos4-e8` and `ocp4-e8` profiles.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc get scansettingbinding e8-scan -n openshift-compliance -o yaml
----

* With this the scan will start as you can check with the CRD of ComplianceScan.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc get compliancescan -n openshift-compliance ocp4-cis
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
 oc get compliancescan -n openshift-compliance
NAME       PHASE     RESULT
ocp4-cis   RUNNING   NOT-AVAILABLE
----

* After the scan is done, you'll see it was persistent in the relevant namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc get compliancescan -n openshift-compliance

----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
NAME       PHASE   RESULT
ocp4-cis   DONE    NON-COMPLIANT
----

[#compliance_operator_acs_review]
=== Review Compliance Scans of the Compliance Operator in RHACS

After completing the previous steps, you will be able to find the results from the Compliance Operator compliance reports in RHACS.

* If RHACS was installed prior to the Compliance Operator, we'll need to restart the ACS sensor in the OpenShift cluster to see these results.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
oc delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=sensor -n stackrox
----

* With the Sensor restarted, kick off a compliance scan in ACS to see the updated results:

image::compliance/01_compliance_scan.png[ACS 4, 300]

In the ACS User Interface, select Compliance from the left menu, and click Scan Environment in the top menu bar.
The scan should only take a few seconds; once it's complete you should see entries for both the ACS built-in and compliance operator standards:

* Check that the ocp4-cis report from the Compliance Operator is shown in ACS Compliance Dashboard:

image::compliance/03_compliance_operator_in_acs.png[ACS 5, 500]

* To see the detailed results, click on the name or bar of any of the standards. To investigate the results of the OpenShift CIS benchmark scan, for example, click ocp4-cis:

[#acs_policy_compliance]
== Configure Policy in RHACS to Invoke Compliance related Controls

The Built-in standards in RHACS Compliance provide guidance on required configurations to meet each individual control. Standards like PCI, HIPAA, and NIST 800-190 are focused on workloads visible to RHACS, and apply to all workloads running in any Kubernetes cluster that RHACS is installed in.

Much of the control guidance can be implemented using RHACS policies, and providing appropriate policy with enforcement in RHACS can change compliance scores.

As an example, we'll look at a control in the NIST 800-190 that requires that container images be kept up to date, and to use meaningful version tags: "practices should emphasize accessing images using immutable names that specify discrete versions of images to be used."

WARNING: This configuration will change the behavior of your Kubernetes clusters and possibly result in preventing new deployments from being created. After testing, you can quickly revert the changes using the instructions at the end of this section.

* Inspect the NIST 800-190 Guidance for Control 4.2.2
* Navigate back to the RHACS Compliance page.
* In the section labeled "PASSING STANDARDS ACROSS CLUSTERS", click on NIST 800-190.
* Scroll down to control 4.2.2 and examine the control guidance on the right.

The control guidance reads:
"StackRox continuously monitors the images being used by active deployments. StackRox provides
built-in policies that detects if images with insecure tags are being used or if the image being used is pretty old.
Therefore, the cluster is compliant if there are policies that are being enforced that discourages such images from being
deployed."

[#acs_policy_compliance_nist]
=== Enforce Policies that Meet Guidance for NIST Control 4.2.2

There are two separate default system policies that, together, meet this control's guidance, "90-day Image Age," and "Latest tag". Both must have enforcement enabled for this control to be satisfied.

1. Navigate to Platform Configuration -> Policy Management
2. Find and click on the policy named, "90-day Image Age" which by default is second in the list. We're not going to change this policy other than to enable enforcement.
3. Click Actions -> Edit Policy to get to the Policy settings.
4. Click Next at the bottom panel to get to the Policy Behavior page.
5. On the response method options, click Inform and Enforce.
6. Click on for both Build and Deploy enforcement. 
7. Click Next at the bottom panel until you get to Review Policy page.
8. Click Save.
9. At the main Policy Management page, find the Policy named, "Latest tag" and repeat steps 3 - 8 to enable enforcement and save the policy.

[#acs_policy_compliance_nist_view]
=== View Updated Compliance Scan Results in RHACS

* In order to see the impact on NIST 800-190 scores:
* Navigate back to the compliance page.
* Click "Scan Environment" in the upper right.
* In the section labeled "PASSING STANDARDS ACROSS CLUSTERS", click on NIST 800-190.
* Scroll down to control 4.2.2 and verify that the control now reports 100% compliance.

[#acs_policy_compliance_nist_revert]
=== Revert the Policy Changes

To avoid rejecting any other deployments to the cluster, you should disable the enforcement after viewing the updated RHACS results.

Navigate to Platform Configuration -> Policy Management
Find and click on the policy named, "90-day Image Age" which by default is second in the list. Click Edit to get to the Policy settings.

* Click Actions -> Edit Policy to get to the Policy settings.
* Click Next at the bottom panel to get to the Policy Behavior page.
* On the response method options, click Inform.
* Click Next at the bottom panel until you get to Review Policy page.
* Click Save.
* At the main Policy Management page, find the Policy named, "Latest tag" and repeat the steps to disable enforcement and save the policy.
